# Practical 05

This folder contains C code from practical05 of Scientific Programming. One file "Fibonacci.c", deals with recursion and using pointers to swap the values of variables. The other, "Hyperbolic_Tan.c", gets a real number input from the users and uses that to calculate estimates for the arctanh function. 

## Compilation
Compile the scripts using:
* gcc -o Fibonacci Fibonacci.c
* gcc -o Hyperbolic_Tan Hyperbolic_Tan.c -lm

## Execute
Once the codes have been compiled execute using:
* ./Fibonacci
* ./Hyperbolic_Tan
