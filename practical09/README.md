# Practical09

This practical deals with the problem of checking if a square is magic or not. For this problem, we dynamically allocated memory for 2D arrays and filled the entries by reading data from a file. The function checking if a square is magic or not is declared in the header file, 'magic_square.h'. The user is aked to input the name of a file containing a square matrix and the program will let you know if it is Magic or not. Two test files have been uploaded also.
